The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) document how Python will evolve over time.
Unlike C, Python allow for dynamically typed variables.
Single line comments in Python use the "#" sign.
Ints do not contain a decimal point while floats do.
Python also supports complex numbers with "j" rather than "i".
Strings are used to store characters rather than numbers.
Logical expressions return booleans, which are either true or false.
Logical expressions are used in if, for, and while statements.
Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries all contain collections of data.
Python lists are ordered and changable.
Python tuples are ordered but unchangable.
Items in Python sets cannot be changed, but items can be added or removed.
Python dictionaries stores data in key:value pairs.
Python is considered to be an object orientented programming (OOP) language.
Almost everything in Python is an object, and new objects can be created.
A new class can be created in Python using the "class" keyword.
Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.
A variable inside a function has a local scope.
A variable outside a function has a global scope.
Global variables can be accessed anywhere inside the program.
Local variables can only be accessed inside the function it is defined in.
Python allows for importing modules that add functionality to a program.
Many community made Python modules with many purposes exist.
Some popular Python modules include NumPy, Tk, and Matplotlib.
