# Speed-Typing
This program allows the user to test how fast they can type sentences. 
Once the program starts, a sentence displaying some fact about Python will be displayed and the user needs to type the sentence as fast as possible.
Like with many other speed typing programs, if a letter has been typed correctly, it will have a green background. However, if it has been typed incorrectly, it will have a red background.

Once the last character has been typed, statistics including the user's time, words per minute (WPM), and the accuracy will be displayed.
When the statistics are displayed, the user can enter the backquote key (`) to reset their statistics and type in a new sentence.
This program also allows for fullscreen compatability. Press F12 to toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode or press Escape when in fullscreen mode to enter windowed mode.

This program's dependencies that are not included with Python is mainly Pygame. Pygame is used to create the window as well as to display the game objects. Other depencies that are built into Python include os, time, and random.
